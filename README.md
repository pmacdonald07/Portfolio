Professional Portfolio Webpage

The goal of this project was to create a professional portfolio that I can update throughout the UNC Coding Bootcamp and my career beyond the bootcamp.

To complete this goal I did the following:
    Used Google Slides to create a wireframe of the webpage.
    Wrote the HTML and CSS code frome scratch.
    Used flexbox to build each section piece by piece.
    Made a navigation bar that links to different sections of the webpage.
    In the section showcasing my work, I make clickable images that link to the live webpages of projects I've completed.
    Created a contact section in the footer with links to my email address and Github page.
    Used HTML semantic elements and alt text to make my portfolio more accessible.

By completing this project I've learned a great deal about website design, and how to create an engaging portfolio that I am incredibly proud of. Creating this webpage from scratch was very challenging, but was terrific practice. I made mistakes, had several "eureka" moments, and can't wait to add more to this portfolio as I learn new techniques.
